As a provisioning operation, this call is subject to a Key Management limit that applies to
the total number of requests across all provisioning read operations. Key Management might
throttle this call to reject an otherwise valid request when the total rate of provisioning
read operations exceeds 10 requests per second for a given tenancy.

```hcl
data "oci_kms_vaults" "test_vaults" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
}
```

* `vaults` - The list of vaults.

### Vault Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment that contains a particular vault.
* `crypto_endpoint` - The service endpoint to perform cryptographic operations against.

* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - A user-friendly name for the vault. It does not have to be unique, and it is changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `external_key_manager_metadata_summary` - Summary about metadata of external key manager to be returned to the customer as a response.

	* `replication_id` - ReplicationId associated with a vault operation 
* `restored_from_vault_id` - The OCID of the vault from which this vault was restored, if it was restored from a backup file. If you restore a vault to the same region, the vault retains the same OCID that it had when you backed up the vault. 
* `state` - The vault's current lifecycle state.  Example: `DELETED`
