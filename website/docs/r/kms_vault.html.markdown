# oci_kms_vault
This resource provides the Vault resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Kms service.

Creates a new vault. The type of vault you create determines key placement, pricing, and
available options. Options include storage isolation, a dedicated service endpoint instead
of a shared service endpoint for API calls, and either a dedicated hardware security module
(HSM) or a multitenant HSM.

As a provisioning operation, this call is subject to a Key Management limit that applies to
the total number of requests across all provisioning write operations. Key Management might
throttle this call to reject an otherwise valid request when the total rate of provisioning
write operations exceeds 10 requests per second for a given tenancy.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_kms_vault" "test_vault" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	display_name = var.vault_display_name
	vault_type = var.vault_vault_type

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	external_key_manager_metadata {
		#Required
		external_vault_endpoint_url = var.vault_external_key_manager_metadata_external_vault_endpoint_url
		oauth_metadata {
			#Required
			client_app_id = oci_kms_client_app.test_client_app.id
			client_app_secret = var.vault_external_key_manager_metadata_oauth_metadata_client_app_secret
			idcs_account_name_url = var.vault_external_key_manager_metadata_oauth_metadata_idcs_account_name_url
		}
		private_endpoint_id = oci_dataflow_private_endpoint.test_private_endpoint.id
	}
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
}
```

		* `client_app_secret` - (Required) Secret of the client app created in IDP.
		* `idcs_account_name_url` - (Required) Base URL of the IDCS account where confidential client app is created.
	* `private_endpoint_id` - (Required) OCID of private endpoint created by customer.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `restore_from_file` - (Optional) (Updatable) Details where vault was backed up.
    * `content_length` - content length of vault's backup binary file

* `restore_from_object_store` - (Optional) (Updatable) Details where vault was backed up
    * `bucket` - (Optional) (Updatable) Name of the bucket where vault was backed up
    * `destination` - (Required) (Updatable) Type of backup to restore from. Values of "BUCKET", "PRE_AUTHENTICATED_REQUEST_URI" are supported
    * `namespace` - (Optional) (Updatable) Namespace of the bucket where vault was backed up
    * `object` - (Optional) (Updatable) Object containing the backup
    * `uri` - (Optional) (Updatable) Pre-authenticated-request-uri of the backup* `restore_trigger` - (Optional) (Updatable) An optional property when flipped triggers restore from restore option provided in config file.
